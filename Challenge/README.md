I worked with Aman Gill for this challenge. We followed pair-programming methodology and the code and readme were co-created.

# **PyCitySchools School Performance Analysis**

## **Project Overview**

We are performing School performance audit for a school Board. The following tasks need to be performed:

1. School board identified evidence of academic dishonesty, in reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders.
2. Replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.
3. Create the following summary reports:
    1. The district summary
    2. The school summary
    3. The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
    4. The average math score for each grade level from each school
    6. The average reading score for each grade level from each school
    7. The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type

**Data Source:** schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
**Software:** Python 3.9.7, Pandas library, NumPy library, jupyter notebook

## **Results**

Following is the summary of different types of analysis that was performed after replacing Thomas High Schoolâ€™s Math and Reading scores.
